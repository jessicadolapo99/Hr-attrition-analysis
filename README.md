- Employees with a Bachelor's degree contributed the most to attrition, while male employees experienced a higher attrition rate (63%) compared to female employees (37%).
- Employees who rarely traveled or lived farther from work were more likely to leave.
- Attrition was most prevalent among employees aged 26–35, and low-performing employees showed higher turnover rates.
